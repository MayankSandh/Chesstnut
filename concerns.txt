for en passant, a more efficient way would be to make a signal for en passant which activates on the enemy's move instead of our move!
what I mean to say is, when an enemy double pushes a pawn, and there is an enemy pawn right beside it, send out an information packet which has the index of the right beside pawn, the direction of the en passant available as well
and the next make move makes the enpassant null void

king has very special set of moves, that is, that it cannot attack a protected piece

checkmate as well as pinned piece

each move should come with a flag or checker if it is available for promotiom or not, so that there is a further move branching into the pieces which can be selected

for virtual moves and castling constants, you can create antoher constant handler which keeps the earlier version of constants and then restores them and unMake (might be heavy tho)

make sure kingCheck moves are somehow handled

rook capture is equivalent to rook moved

if piece of opponent is lower, then exchange more pieces

implement book moves if possible

i can't play for black some constants issue

castling constant still not fixed

keep track of king location in order to not search for king again and again

legalsquarse funciton doesn't have a king block in the check block

VERY IMPORTANT ERROR
    (HANDLED)THE UPDATE OF PIECELOCATION ONLY CONSIDERS THE ATTACK SPACE OF THE PIECE CLICKED, BUT FORGETS ABOUT THE DISCOVERY OF A SLIDING PIECE OR EVEN AN ENEMEY PIECE!
    PINNED PIECE ALSO NOT WORKING CORRECTLY!
    NO NEED FOR A SEPARATE KINGPINGHANDLER FOR FINDING PINNED PIECE, WE CAN FIND THEM USING ATTACK PIECE CALCULATIONS ONLY! (ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT INEFFICIENT)
    INSTEAD OF CALCULATING ATTACKING SQUARES ALL OVER AGAIN, WE CAN CACHE IT

Weirdly, after handling a check, I can't move any piece
This means that king is still considered as check, and also that makeMove functoin needs to update the locationList better
