for en passant, a more efficient way would be to make a signal for en passant which activates on the enemy's move instead of our move!
what I mean to say is, when an enemy double pushes a pawn, and there is an enemy pawn right beside it, send out an information packet which has the index of the right beside pawn, the direction of the en passant available as well
and the next make move makes the enpassant null void

king has very special set of moves, that is, that it cannot attack a protected piece

checkmate as well as pinned piece

each move should come with a flag or checker if it is available for promotiom or not, so that there is a further move branching into the pieces which can be selected

for virtual moves and castling constants, you can create antoher constant handler which keeps the earlier version of constants and then restores them and unMake (might be heavy tho)

make sure kingCheck moves are somehow handled

rook capture is equivalent to rook moved

if piece of opponent is lower, then exchange more pieces

implement book moves if possible

i can't play for black some constants issue

castling constant still not fixed

keep track of king location in order to not search for king again and again
