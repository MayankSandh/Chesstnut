(DONE) EVEN DURING CHECK, BLACK ROOK JUST PHASES THROUGH THE KING LIKE A PSEUDO CASTLING (CASTLING CONSTANTS NOT CHANGED AFTER KING MOVED!)

ENDGAME MOVING TAKING TIME IN MILLISECONDS (EITIHER PIECES ARE TOO LESS, OR SELF RESTRICTING MOVES DUE TO SOMEM WEIRD CHECK CONDITION)

(DONE) SOMETIMES, THE MOVE LIST IS BLANK (I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY) {BAD STORING OF MOVES DURING CHECK}

(DONE) DURING CHECK, KING CAN'T TAKE THE PIECES THEMSELVES(MAYBE OVERCOUNTING OF ATTACKINGLOCAITONS)

(DONE) IF THE KING HAS BEEN CHECKED ONCE, EVEN AFTER HANDLING THE CHECK, ALL THE OTHER PIECES REFUSE TO MOVE, ONLY THE KING CAN MOVE APPARENTLY

(DONE) CASTLING CANNOT BE DONE UNDER CHECK

(DONE) SQUAREWITHINBOUNDS CHECK NEEDED'
 
NO NEED FOR SUCH A BIG ASS FUNCTOIN FOR KING HANDLER, YOU CAN HANDLER THE DIRECTION OF BOARD, IN THE PAWN BLOKC ITSELF

IMPLEMENT ENDGAME HEATMAP FOR KING

PAWN ENDGAME HEATMAP SHOULD BE CHANGED AS WELL (JUST INCREMENTING VALUES WITH FILE)

PASSED PAWN DETECTOR

FALSE STALEMATE
