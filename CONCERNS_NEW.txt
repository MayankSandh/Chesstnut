(DONE) BLACK KING DOES NOT RESPECT CHECK

(DONE) EVEN DURING CHECK, BLACK ROOK JUST PHASES THROUGH THE KING LIKE A PSEUDO CASTLING (CASTLING CONSTANTS NOT CHANGED AFTER KING MOVED!)

ENDGAME MOVING TAKING TIME IN MILLISECONDS (EITIHER PIECES ARE TOO LESS, OR SELF RESTRICTING MOVES DUE TO SOMEM WEIRD CHECK CONDITION)

SOMETIMES, THE MOVE LIST IS BLANK (I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY)

DURING CHECK, KING CAN'T TAKE THE PIECES THEMSELVES(MAYBE OVERCOUNTING OF ATTACKINGLOCAITONS)

IF THE KING HAS BEEN CHECKED ONCE, EVEN AFTER HANDLING THE CHECK, ALL THE OTHER PIECES REFUSE TO MOVE, ONLY THE KING CAN MOVE APPARENTLY

CASTLING CANNOT BE DONE UNDER CHECK

SQUAREWITHINBOUNDS CHECK NEEDED'
 
NO NEED FOR SUCH A BIG ASS FUNCTOIN FOR KING HANDLER, YOU CAN HANDLER THE DIRECTION OF BOARD, IN THE PAWN BLOKC ITSELF

QUEEN CAN PHASE INTO PINNED PIECES AS WELL!

UPDATE ATTACK SQUARE FUNCTION FOR THE KINIG MIGHT BE FAULT

(DONE)if targetSquare not in AttackSquares

BLACK PLAYS A STUUPID PAWN MOVE INSTEAD OF CHECKMATE ERROR

YOU NEED TO HANDLE KING BETTER IN KING HANDLER FUNCTION

WHY DOES OPPONENT THINK THAT GIVING ME A CHECK WILL GIVE IT A GOOD EVALUATION
