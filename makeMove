handle castling
handle promotion

make sure to create a signal inside the functino which separatest the fake function call from the real one (should not mess with global variables like that)

pawn promotion unmake

castling unmake


pawn crosses self pieces

when rook is captured, consider rook moved


when pawn promoted, handle the flag 

make sure in the kingcheckhandler, you remove all the self square move in the attacking squares part, because if king can kill a checking piece, it might not detect the capture
